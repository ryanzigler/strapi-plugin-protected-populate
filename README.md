> [!CAUTION]
> This is a temporary fork of [strapi-plugin-protected-populate](https://github.com/strapi-community/strapi-plugin-protected-populate) meant only to fix an issue with custom component icons. Other than commenting out a few lines of code, all credit for this plugin goes to [Boegie19](https://github.com/Boegie19) and you almost certainly want to use their [original version of the plugin](https://github.com/strapi-community/strapi-plugin-protected-populate).

## üö¶ Current Status

For more information on contributing please see [the contrib message below](#contributing).

## ‚ú® Features

These are the primary features that are finished or currently being worked on:

- [x] Protected your Get request populates and fields
- [x] Allow you to protect routes per role

## ü§î Motivation

The purpose of this plugin is to have a easy way to protect your get endpoints from getting to much information out of them.
I made this plugin since I got sick and tired of writing complex policies to do this exact thing.
